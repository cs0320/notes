# How to read these notes

## Livecode Repository 

These notes are meant to be read in conjunction with the [course livecode repository](https://github.com/cs0320/class-livecode). Often, the notes and repository contain useful information that there isn't time to cover in class. 

## Exercises

If you see an expandable piece of text, like this:
<details>
<summary>Think, then click.</summary>

Text for you to read _after_ thinking or doing an exercise...

</details>
</br>
stop and think, or do the related exercise, before expanding.
