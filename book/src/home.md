# How to read these notes

Welcome to CSCI 0320/1340! 

This page contains the _lecture notes_ for the course. With JavaScript enabled, the table of contents will allow you to select a specific chapter. Likewise, the search icon should allow you to search for arbitrary words throughout all the notes. The lecture indexing is for Spring 2024. 

Please note that some lectures will be done entirely via slides, etc.; those aren't present in this collection. 

~~~admonish warning title="These notes are not final!" 
This outline is subject to change, and notes are often modified in response to TA feedback or student Q&A before class. Some notes will be greyed out and inaccessible in the table of contents.

stop and think, or do the related exercise, before expanding.
