# How to read these notes

Welcome to CSCI 0320/1340! 

This page contains the _lecture notes_ for the course. With JavaScript enabled, the table of contents will allow you to select a specific chapter. Likewise, the search icon should allow you to search for arbitrary words throughout all the notes. The lecture indexing is for **Fall 2025**. Some lectures are mainly done via slides, in which case we will attempt to link the slides here as well. 

These notes are meant to be accompanied by the [course live code repository](https://github.com/cs0320/class-livecode), which contains a collection of code examples done in and out of class. The course assumes that students will review the live code.

~~~admonish warning title="These notes are not final!" 
This outline is subject to change, and notes are often modified in response to TA feedback or student Q&A before class. Some notes will be greyed out and inaccessible in the table of contents.
