# Group Projects and Code Review 

Because the `mdbook` package, which I use to write these notes, doesn't easily support external links in the table of contents, this page exists. Please go [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bsDN2dMTvC8kFfJNxH4yau6ENemFxxpNKdL6ts3kjHA) to access the slides.

## Supplemental Example for Dependency Injection 

I added another small, self-contained example (vignette) for dependency-injection [here](https://github.com/cs0320/class-livecode/tree/main/S25/vignettes/dep-injection-example). Think about how this example applies to both testing and parallel development on the same project.
