# Requirements and Firebase

Because the `mdbook` package, which I use to write these notes, doesn't easily support external links in the table of contents, this page exists. Please go [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q9gEEYu7I6wrIYwM1t2iMewlHWT7SLI4dAc8vLxotA8) to access the slides.

## Supplemental Example: Firebase in React NYT

See [this repo](https://github.com/tnelson/reactNYT/tree/main) for the real deployed React NYT example. Make sure you read the README file; it contains notes about the development process and features.
